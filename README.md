# Express.js Server-side Framework
A lightweight, production-ready Express.js server-side framework scaffold designed for MERN-stack development — created and maintained by Olaweb24. This repository provides a sensible project structure, built-in middleware, authentication hooks, error handling, logging, environment management, and deployment-ready defaults so you can focus on building features instead of boilerplate.

Why this project
----------------
This starter framework is intended for developers building REST APIs or GraphQL backends for MERN stack applications. It contains:
- Common production-ready defaults (CORS, security headers, request-rate limiting)
- JWT-based auth scaffolding with extensible user model hooks
- Centralized error-handling and structured logging
- Clear folder structure with separation of concerns so teams can scale fast

Features
--------
- Express 4.x/5.x compatible scaffold
- Environment-configured (dotenv)
- Request validation (Joi / express-validator — replaceable)
- Authentication with JWT (login/register middleware)
- Role-based authorization middleware
- Central error handler and standardized error responses
- Request logging (morgan or winston integration)
- Rate limiting (express-rate-limit)
- CORS and security headers (helmet)
- Easy to extend: plug in new routes/controllers/services
- Ready for Docker and common cloud providers

Getting started
---------------

Prerequisites
- Node.js >= 16 (LTS recommended)
- npm >= 8 or yarn

Clone and install
```bash
git clone https://github.com/PLP-MERN-Stack-Development/express-js-server-side-framework-Olaweb24.git
cd express-js-server-side-framework-Olaweb24
npm install
# or
# yarn install
```

Environment variables
---------------------
Copy the example env file and update values:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Example .env (the repository may include .env.example; these variables are typical)
```env
NODE_ENV=development
PORT=4000

# Auth
JWT_SECRET=replace_with_a_strong_secret
JWT_EXPIRES_IN=7d

# Logging
LOG_LEVEL=info

# Rate limiting
RATE_LIMIT_WINDOW_MS=900000    # 15 minutes
RATE_LIMIT_MAX=100

# Optional: SMTP for emails
SMTP_HOST=smtp.mailtrap.io
SMTP_PORT=587
SMTP_USER=
SMTP_PASS=

# Other keys (e.g., third-party APIs)
SENTRY_DSN=
```

Scripts
-------
Typical npm scripts included in this scaffold (check package.json):
- npm run dev — start server with nodemon for development
- npm start — start server (production)
- npm run lint — run linters (eslint)
- npm run test — run unit/integration tests
- npm run build — build step (if using TS or bundlers)

Project structure
-----------------
The scaffold follows a conventional structure. Adjust paths to your project conventions.

- /src
  - /config          # config loaders, env parsing
  - /server          # server bootstrap (express app, middlewares)
  - /routes          # route definitions (versioned e.g., v1)
  - /controllers     # HTTP handlers (thin, call services)
  - /services        # Business logic, database operations
  - /models          # DB models / schemas
  - /middlewares     # auth, validation, error handling, rate-limiting
  - /utils           # helpers (logger, email, token utils)
  - /scripts         # helper scripts (seed, migrations)
- /config            # non-source config (optional)
- .env.example
- package.json
- Dockerfile
- docker-compose.yml

Core concepts & patterns
------------------------

Routing and controllers
- Routes define endpoints and plug middlewares (auth, validation).
- Controllers are kept thin: they validate inputs (if not handled by middleware), call services, and send responses.
- Services contain business logic and DB interactions. This separation makes unit testing straightforward.

Middleware
- Global middleware included:
  - helmet for security headers
  - cors for cross-origin access
  - express.json() and urlencoded
  - morgan/winston for request logging
  - rate limiter to protect from brute force / DDoS
- Route-specific middleware:
  - authentication (JWT verification)
  - authorization (role checks)
  - request validation (Joi or express-validator schemas)

Authentication & Authorization
- JWT-based token generation and verification.
- Login endpoint issues signed tokens with configurable expiry (JWT_SECRET + JWT_EXPIRES_IN).
- Protected routes should use auth middleware which decodes token and attaches user info to req.user.
- Authorization middleware enforces role-based access (e.g., isAdmin, isOwner).


Validation
- Prefer validating request payloads before controllers. Use schemas (Joi or express-validator) and a validation middleware that returns 400 on invalid input with standardized error payloads.

Error handling
- All controllers and route handlers should forward errors to next(err).
- A central error handler formats errors and returns appropriate HTTP status codes and JSON responses:
  - 400 Bad Request — validation errors
  - 401 Unauthorized — auth failures
  - 403 Forbidden — authorization failures
  - 404 Not Found — missing resources
  - 429 Too Many Requests — rate limit reached
  - 5xx — internal server errors (hide internal details in production)
- Optionally integrate Sentry for error tracking (SENTRY_DSN).

Logging
- Use structured logging (winston recommended) and differentiate by environment:
  - development: console-friendly output
  - production: JSON output to stdout/stderr for container ingestion
- Log request metadata (method, path, status, response time) and errors with stack traces for non-prod.

API conventions & examples
-------------------------

General response format (recommended)
```json
{
  "status": "success" | "error",
  "message": "Human-friendly message",
  "data": { /* resource or null */ },
  "errors": [ /* optional, detailed error list */ ]
}
```

Health check
- Endpoint: GET /health
- Response:
```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "message": "OK",
  "data": {
    "uptime": 12345,
    "timestamp": "2025-10-19T00:00:00.000Z",
    "database": "connected"
  }
}
```

JSON API example — Authentication
- Register: POST /api/v1/auth/register
  - body: { "name": "Alice", "email": "alice@example.com", "password": "P@ssw0rd" }
- Login: POST /api/v1/auth/login
  - body: { "email": "alice@example.com", "password": "P@ssw0rd" }
  - response: { "token": "JWT_TOKEN", "expiresIn": "7d" }

Protected route example
- GET /api/v1/users/profile
- Headers: Authorization: Bearer JWT_TOKEN
- Returns user profile attached to token

cURL example
```bash
# Health
curl -X GET http://localhost:4000/health

# Login
curl -X POST http://localhost:4000/api/v1/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"alice@example.com","password":"P@ssw0rd"}'
```

Testing
-------
- Unit tests for controllers, services, and utilities should run in isolation.
- Integration tests should spin up test DB instances (in-memory MongoDB or test containers).
- Recommended tools: Jest, supertest, sinon/mock libraries.
- Example:
```bash
npm run test
# or run a specific test
npm run test -- tests/controllers/auth.test.js
```

Deployment
----------
This project is ready for typical cloud deployments (Heroku, AWS Elastic Beanstalk, Azure App Service, Google App Engine) or containerized deployment (Docker + Kubernetes).

Docker (example)
- Provided Dockerfile and docker-compose.yml should help you build and run the app locally in a container.

CI/CD
- Use GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, or other pipelines to:
  - Lint and test on pull requests
  - Build container images and push to registry
  - Deploy from main branch to production

Environment tips
- Never commit .env files or secrets to Git.
- Use secret managers (AWS Secrets Manager, GitHub Secrets) in CI/CD.

Best practices & recommended workflow
-------------------------------------
- Branching: feature/short-description, fix/..., hotfix/...
- Use pull requests for all changes and require reviews.
- Keep controllers thin, put logic in services.
- Write tests alongside features.
- Keep environment-specific config out of code (use env vars).
- Use semantic versioning for releases.
